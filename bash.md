bash basics

## Foundations

#### Operations on directories and paths

To get to your home directory you do:

```bash
cd
```

or 

```bash
cd ~/
```
or you can specify an `explicit` path such as

```bash
cd /home/youruser
```

to check your `present directory` run

```bash
pwd
```

So, for a file `mydatabase.json` finding themselves in `absolute` (explicit) path of:

`/home/youruser/db/backups/`

when you run `mongo` from path of `/home/youruser/db/` you can referr to the file in three different ways:

 * `/home/youruser/db/backups/mydatabase.json` (absolute/explicit)
 * `~/db/backups/mydatabase.json` (absolute but using a shorthand of `$HOME`)
 * `./backups/mydatabase.json` (from a context path where you run your mongo)

#### Capturing keyboard input into file and outputing files contents

```bash
$ cat > newfile.txt # creates file if does not exist
hello 
[Ctrl+D]
$ cat newfile.txt 
hello
$ cat >> newfile.txt # appends line(s) to a file
world
[Ctrl+D]
$ cat newfile.txt 
hello
world
```
### Looking up JSON "pretty"

For a given piece of `minified` JSON [for a web minifier see here](http://www.webtoolkitonline.com/json-minifier.html) that is also a `valid` JSON - [jsonlint](https://jsonlint.com/).

```json
{"as":"AS16509 Amazon.com, Inc.","city":"Boardman","country":"United States","countryCode":"US","isp":"Amazon","lat":45.8696,"lon":-119.688,"org":"Amazon","query":"54.148.84.95","region":"OR","regionName":"Oregon","status":"success","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","zip":"97818"}
```

```bash
json-pretty filename.json
```

gives you:

```json
{
    "as": "AS16509 Amazon.com, Inc.",
    "city": "Boardman",
    "country": "United States",
    "countryCode": "US",
    "isp": "Amazon",
    "lat": 45.8696,
    "lon": -119.688,
    "org": "Amazon",
    "query": "54.148.84.95",
    "region": "OR",
    "regionName": "Oregon",
    "status": "success",
    "timezone": "America/Los_Angeles",
    "zip": "97818"
}
```
